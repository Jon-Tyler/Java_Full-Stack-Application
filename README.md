# Java_Full-Stack-Application
Over the duration of the associates degree college education. Students were tasked with creating a program for the final assignment of many programming courses. At the time I completed this assignment for an advanaced java course, it was a standalone program. As I grew conceptually and with programmatical skills. I decided to extend the program with a REST API built on top of it as well as front-end and back-end contributions.

What you will see is the java code for the program of the final assignment. Any future commits will either re-structure the design pattern of the program or contribute to the overall program. 

Next Stages of the Program
---------------------------
ADD a MySQL or MongoDB Database as the backend of the program.

ADD either an Angular.js or REACT.js Front End to communicate with the REST API.
