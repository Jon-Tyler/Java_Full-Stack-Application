# Java_Full-Stack-Application

Over the duration of the associates degree college education. Students were tasked with creating a program for the final assignment of many programming courses. At the time I completed this assignment for an advanced java course, it was a standalone program. As I grew conceptually and with programmatical skills. I decided to extend the program with a REST API built on top of it.

What you will see is the C# code for the program of the final assignment. Any future commits will either re-structure the design pattern of the program or

Next Stages of the Program
ADD a MySQL or MongoDB Database as the backend of the program.
ADD either an Angular.js or REACT.js Front End to communicate with the REST API.
